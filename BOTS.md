# Bots on Botmakers.org

On top of a few people testing their bots, we have the following integrations:

## slack-tableflip

[![slack-tableflip](https://botwiki.org/content/bots/slackbots/images/slack-tableflip.png)](https://botwiki.org/bots/slackbots/slack-tableflip/)

See screenshot above. You can use this bot in any channel -- with a reasonable frequency.

## MeMoji

[![MeMoji](https://botwiki.org/content/bots/slackbots/images/MeMoji.png)](https://botwiki.org/bots/slackbots/MeMoji/)

A sort of "charades with emoji" game. There is a dedicated channel [#games-memoji](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/games-memoji/details/).

The original idea behind MeMoji was to have people create their own games (using `/memoji create {phrase} {emoji list}`), but there's a few built-in phrases. You can start a new game with `/memoji start` (after a game is over, you will have to start a new game again) and then make your guess with `/memoji guess {phrase}`.

For more commands see [memoji.mod.bz](https://memoji.mod.bz/).

## @botwikibot

And of course, our very own [@botwikibot](https://botwiki.org/projects/#botwikibot). It's still a very early work in progress, but it can say *hello* and helps monitor our [#twitter-firehose](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/twitter-firehose/details/) channel.

We plan on adding many more features in the future!

## Notes

We also have the **Food** and **Startups** emoji packs from [emojipacks.com](http://www.emojipacks.com/).
